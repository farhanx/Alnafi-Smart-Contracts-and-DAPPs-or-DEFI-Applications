Hi this is Farhan Khan, here you can find some of my code especially written to help you in building blockchain based solutions.

Examples are: 

- Blockchain Stuff, Smart contracts, Truffle solutions, dAPPs,  Erc-20 Token, NFTs, DeFi , Web3, Solidity, Ethereum, and many more.  

Courses details: https://portal.alnafi.com/pages/blockchain-course-detail 

The code is divided into four different folder where you can find 

# 1 - Programming in Ethereum (Solidity and Smart contracts)
In this folder I have shared some examples how you can build smart contracts using solidity languae. We are using Solidity and JAvascript in order to test our contracts by using Truffle framework.

This course is the first course that will introduce you to core concepts about blockchain technology and its working flow. We will be starting from technical theory about public blockchain Ethereum and then taking you on the journey to begin creating your transactions. It will provide you with enough knowledge so that you can quickly start writing your own smart contract using the Ethereum Solidity language. If you are already working in any object-oriented programming language, you can easily understand Solidity concepts. But if you have never worked in any programming language before, it is recommended to join this course after reading object-oriented programming concepts. We will do several exercises to teach you how to set up and configure your system with pre-requisites tools for working in blockchain technologies. At the end of this course, you will have the skills to set up an ethereum node, run a truffle framework, compile using solidity, create a smart contract, use the Ganache simulator, and many more. We will use test networks of the Ethereum blockchain network like Ropsten and Rinkeby for live transactions or smart contract experiments.We will also learn how to store values like Ethers in the smart contract addresses and how an owner can withdraw this money.

# 2 - Decentralized Application Development ( dAPP or DAPPS) 

This course is the second course from the blockchain specialization track; you must have completed the first course before starting this course. Also, you must have a minimal understanding of website development and database concepts as pre-requisites.It teaches you why many models in the world should become decentralized instead of centralized furthermore, why centralized systems are not healthy in some traditional critical systems. This course will teach you the next generation WEB 3 technology and web application development called "DAPP" Decentralized Application. This course will teach you how you can connect your web application directly with the blockchain network using Web3 libraries. How to call a smart contract using HTML based interface and how decentralized storage works. You will host your DAPP using IPFS (interplanetary File System) in this journey, and you will learn how nodeJS or PHP based apache servers should use in the local computer development. You will also learn MetaMask usage in DAPP exercises, especially when you will call your smart contract using MetaMask.

# 3 - Security Role in the Blockchain 

This course will expose you to the sensitivity of the solidity language and its smart contracts. It will give you insight and knowledge about why security best practices are essential in designing any DAPP or a contact. It will take you on the journey from the beginning of DAO and forking results. Attack vectors and best security patterns to implement in the smart contracts. Complete insights and exercises on how to use Oracles services using third-party oracle services like probable and chainlink. How to resolve vulnerabilities within a smart contract, and what are the upgrade patterns.

# 4 - DEFI Application development 

This course is the last one for public blockchain engineering. We will discuss Decentralized Finance DEFI and its protocols. We will understand how crypto and tokenomic works. What are fungible and non-fungible tokens, how to implement ERC-20 tokens or ERC-721 NFT tokens using your own smart contracts. We will also deep dive into ITO, STO, IEO, and stable coin works. Protocols like Liquidity Pool, Decentralized Exchanges DEX, CEX, and Uniswap will be discussed with practical.
