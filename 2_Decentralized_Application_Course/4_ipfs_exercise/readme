This will return a unique CID hash 
> added QmakTN4o7NW5nJTqbMzAu9KhTQsN7Cn3tXpfeRTEaTPABY Readme.md

6 - Create a new folder myFiles , and then go to the commandline in the same folder. Use the below command to retrieved the published file
> ipfs get QmakTN4o7NW5nJTqbMzAu9KhTQsN7Cn3tXpfeRTEaTPABY
It will return you the same file you have publised

7 - Experiments with other files


8 - Publish new file
 > ipfs add "anyfile.ext"

9 - Download same file 
 > ipfs get "hash_CID"

10 - Download same file with proper extension
 > ipfs get "QmRHFV12qcftPzYT3LetKxQtW49GiMM6FPbBorABRC9eXf" > "FILENAME.EXT""

11 - Publish directory on the ipfs
 > ipfs add -r "directory name"

12 -  download directory
 > ipfs get "hash_CID"

13 - get JSON format of the directory and files
 > ipfs object get QmWsLj5xgDCz91XxzHb8AyK6uFhmfdsR6Qb3KCofjdRNid

 Now connect your self with a network
14 - Run ipfs daemon service
 > ipfs daemon

15 - Check how many peers are you connected with
 > ipfs swarm peers

16 - Now upload an html sample file using add command

17 - Take its cid and go to the Brave browser.

18 - On the brave browser write (In case it would show you that you have to install localnode then click install)
  ipfs://CID_HASH

19 - to open this on any other browser use
  
  https://ipfs.io/ipfs/CID_HASH
